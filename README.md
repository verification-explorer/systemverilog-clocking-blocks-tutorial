# SystemVerilog Clocking Blocks & Modports Tutorial

This repository is a hands-on tutorial for understanding and applying **SystemVerilog clocking blocks** and **modports** in a UVM-based testbench environment.

It demonstrates how to:
- Synchronize testbench-to-DUT communication
- Avoid race conditions and timing issues
- Build a cleaner, more robust simulation setup ‚Äî especially at the **gate-level**

## üîß What You'll Learn

### ‚úÖ Clocking Blocks
- How to define and use a clocking block in your interface
- Use of `#1step` skew for realistic input sampling (`tSU`)
- How to drive DUT inputs and sample outputs using `clockvars` like `drv_cb.push`
- Synchronizing using `@(clocking_block_name)` instead of `@(posedge clk)`
- Behavior at RTL vs. gate-level (SDF) simulations

### ‚úÖ Skew Handling
- How clocking blocks resolve DUT-TB synchronization mismatches at gate level

### ‚úÖ Modports
- How to define modports for DUT, driver, and monitor
- Exposing only required signals (e.g., reset and clockvars)
- Preventing direct access to interface signals from testbench components
- Enforcing clean access patterns through virtual interfaces

### ‚úÖ Clean UVM Integration
- Defining `typedef` virtual interfaces for each modport in the agent package
- Declaring and assigning modport-specific interface pointers in the driver and monitor
