### Design Overview

For this tutorial, I chose a **synchronous FIFO RTL design** from the [Verification Academy](https://verificationacademy.com/) tutorials.

Since **clocking blocks** are particularly beneficial in **gate-level simulations**, I synthesized the design using **OpenLane** (an [Efabless](https://efabless.com/) project) with the **Sky130 Process Design Kit (PDK)**.

Let's walk through the design and understand how it works.
